   - Highlight active workflow path
   - Color-code nodes by status
   - Add edge animations

2. **UI/UX Improvements**
   - Better color scheme and contrast
   - Smooth animations and transitions
   - Improved spacing and layout
   - Better mobile responsiveness
   - Loading skeletons

3. **Enhanced Features**

### Step 2: Frontend Engineer - UI Enhancements
- Improve color scheme
- Add animations (fade, slide, pulse)
- Enhance responsive design
- Add loading states
- Improve typography

### Step 3: Frontend Engineer - Feature Additions
- Add agent detail modal/expand
- Implement task filtering
- Add search functionality
- Add sort options

### Step 4: QA Engineer - Testing
- Test workflow graph interactions
- Test responsive design
- Test all new features
- Performance testing

### Step 5: Documentation - Update Docs
- Document new features
- Update user guide
- Add component documentation

## Success Criteria:

- ✅ Interactive workflow graph implemented
- ✅ Smooth animations and transitions
- ✅ Better mobile experience
- ✅ All new features working
- ✅ Performance optimized
- ✅ Tests passing
