## 📋 What Was Done

### 1. Agent Workflow Execution ✅

**Feature Built:** Activity Timeline

**Agents Used:**
1. **Architect Agent** - Designed architecture (5 min)
2. **Frontend Engineer** - Built component (5 min)
3. **Backend Engineer** - Created APIs (5 min)
4. **QA Engineer** - Tested feature (5 min)

**Total Time:** ~20 minutes

### 2. Workflow Analysis ✅

**Analyzed:**
- Coordination effectiveness
- Performance metrics
- Quality of outputs
- Communication patterns
- Issues and bottlenecks

**Findings:**
- ✅ Excellent coordination
- ✅ Fast execution
- ✅ Good quality
- ⚠️ Sequential execution only
- ⚠️ Manual context updates

### 3. System Improvements ✅

**Implemented:**
1. **Automated Activity Logging**
   - Auto-logs agent status changes
   - Auto-logs task execution
   - Auto-logs execution completion/failure

2. **Activity Timeline Feature**
   - Complete timeline component
   - API endpoints
   - Filtering and search
   - Real-time updates

3. **Enhanced Context Updater**
   - Auto-logs status transitions
   - Better tracking
