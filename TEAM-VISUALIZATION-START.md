# 🚀 Team Visualization Dashboard - Quick Start

## ✅ Setup Complete!

The team is ready to build the visualization dashboard. Here's what's been configured:

### Files Created:
- ✅ `.cursor/commands/build-team-visualization.md` - Main workflow
- ✅ Updated `.cursor/agents/shared-context.json` - Project initialized
- ✅ Updated `.cursor/agents/task-board.md` - Tasks added

### Current Status:
- **Project:** Team Visualization Dashboard
- **Phase:** Architecture
- **Architect Agent:** Active (designing dashboard architecture)
- **DevOps Agent:** Waiting for architecture
- **Frontend Agent:** Waiting for architecture and project setup

## 🎯 Next Steps - Start the Team!

### Option 1: Use the Master Workflow
In Cursor chat, type:
```
/build-team-visualization
```

This will coordinate all agents to build the dashboard step by step.

### Option 2: Use Individual Agents
Start with the Architect:
```
/architect-agent
```

Then continue with other agents as they become ready.

### Option 3: Orchestrate the Team
```
/orchestrate-team
```

This will automatically coordinate all agents based on dependencies.

## 📊 What the Team Will Build:

1. **Architect** → Designs dashboard architecture
2. **DevOps** → Sets up React + TypeScript project
3. **Backend** → Creates API (if needed) for real-time updates
4. **Frontend** → Builds visualization components:
   - Agent status cards
   - Workflow graph (React Flow)
   - Task board
   - Quality gates
   - Project overview
5. **QA** → Writes and runs tests
6. **DevOps** → Deploys dashboard
7. **Documentation** → Documents everything

## 🔍 Monitor Progress:

Check these files to see team progress:
- `.cursor/agents/shared-context.json` - Current agent status
- `.cursor/agents/task-board.md` - Task completion status

## 🎨 Expected Result:

A beautiful, real-time dashboard showing:
- ✅ All 7 agents and their status
- ✅ Interactive workflow visualization
- ✅ Real-time task board
- ✅ Quality gate indicators
- ✅ Project progress tracking
